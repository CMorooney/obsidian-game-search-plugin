### New file location

### New file name

You can set the file name format. The default format is `{{title}} - {{author}}`.
You can use `{{DATE}}` or `{{DATE:YYYYMMDD}}` to set a unique file name.

### Template file

You can set the template file location. There is an example template at the bottom.

### Service Provider

You can set up the services that you use to search for books. Only Google and Naver(ÎÑ§Ïù¥Î≤Ñ) are available now.
To use Naver Book Search, clientId and clientSecret are required. I will explain how to get clientId and clientSecret from Naver on my blog.
